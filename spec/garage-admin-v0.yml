  description: |
    Administrate your Garage cluster programatically, including status, layout, keys, buckets, and maintainance tasks.

    *Disclaimer: The API is not stable yet, hence its v0 tag. The API can change at any time, and changes can include breaking backward compatibility. Read the changelog and upgrade your scripts before upgrading. Additionnaly, this specification is very early stage and can contain bugs, especially on error return codes/types that are not tested yet. Do not expect a well finished and polished product!*

        All fields (`websiteAccess` and `quotas`) are optionnal.
        If they are present, the corresponding modifications are applied to the bucket, otherwise nothing is changed.

        In `websiteAccess`: if `enabled` is `true`, `indexDocument` must be specified.
        The field `errorDocument` is optional, if no error document is set a generic
        error message is displayed when errors happen. Conversely, if `enabled` is
        `false`, neither `indexDocument` nor `errorDocument` must be specified.

        In `quotas`: new values of `maxSize` and `maxObjects` must both be specified, or set to `null`
        to remove the quotas. An absent value will be considered the same as a `null`. It is not possible
        to change only one of the two quotas.

        Flags in permissions which have the value true will be activated. Other flags will remain unchanged (ie. they will keep their internal value).

        For example, if you set read to true, the key will be allowed to read the bucket.
        If you set it to false, the key will keeps its previous read permission.
        If you want to disallow read for the key, check the DenyBucketKey operation.
